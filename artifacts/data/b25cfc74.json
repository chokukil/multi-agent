The basic statistical analysis for the numerical columns in the dataset has been completed. Here are the key findings:

| Variable | Mean      | Std Dev   | Min     | 25%      | Median   | 75%      | Max      | Mode | Variance     |
|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|------|--------------|
| pclass   | 2.29      | 0.84      | 1.00    | 2.00     | 3.00     | 3.00     | 3.00     | 3.00 | 0.70         |
| survived | 0.38      | 0.49      | 0.00    | 0.00     | 0.00     | 1.00     | 1.00     | 0.00 | 0.24         |
| age      | 29.88     | 14.41     | 0.17    | 21.00    | 28.00    | 39.00    | 80.00    | 24.00| 207.75       |
| sibsp    | 0.50      | 1.04      | 0.00    | 0.00     | 0.00     | 1.00     | 8.00     | 0.00 | 1.09         |
| parch    | 0.39      | 0.87      | 0.00    | 0.00     | 0.00     | 0.00     | 9.00     | 0.00 | 0.75         |
| fare     | 33.30     | 51.76     | 0.00    | 7.90     | 14.45    | 31.28    | 512.33   | 8.05 | 2678.96      |

**Key Insights**:
- The average fare is significantly high (33.30) with a large standard deviation (51.76), indicating a wide range of ticket prices.
- The age distribution shows a mean of approximately 29.88 years, with a notable standard deviation, suggesting variability in ages among passengers.
- The survival rate is relatively low at 38.2%, with a mode of 0, indicating that more passengers did not survive.

**TASK COMPLETED:** Basic statistical summary for numerical columns has been successfully compiled.
