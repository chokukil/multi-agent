sanitized_input = re.sub(r'<[^>]+>', '', sanitized_input)

# After: Comprehensive sanitization
if BLEACH_AVAILABLE:
    sanitized_input = bleach.clean(sanitized_input, tags=[], attributes={}, strip=True)
else:
    sanitized_input = html.escape(sanitized_input)
    # Additional pattern removal for safety
```
