python --version

# Test NumPy/Pandas compatibility
python -c "import numpy as np; import pandas as pd; print(f'NumPy {np.__version__}, Pandas {pd.__version__}')"

# Test Streamlit
python -c "import streamlit; print(f'Streamlit {streamlit.__version__}')"

# Test Playwright
python -c "from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright; print('Playwright ready')"
